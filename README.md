This is the repository for TLRC 2023-2024

Work in progress. Suggestions welcome - email TLRC Chair Yogesh More at morey@oldwestbury.edu

The file [brain_dump.md](https://github.com/morey-ow/tlrc23-24/blob/master/2023-2024%20Records/brain_dump.md) (maybe it should be re-named) in the ```2023-2024 Records``` folder stores thoughts for things TLRC might consider this year.
