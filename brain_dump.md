## Ideas, issues

### 1. Proposal to Combine TLRC-CETL

See the following page for the Request for Director and Resolution for Director documents by Amy Hsu
https://github.com/morey-ow/tlrc23-24/tree/master/resolution%20for%20TLRC%20director%20(2023)

History:
- Idea (source unknown) originates to combine TLRC and CETL
- Amy Hsu (2022-2023 TLRC Chair) drafts a Senate resolution in January 2023 for combining CETL-TLRC  
- Jo-Ann Robinson suggests writing a proposal instead of a Senate resolution
- Proposal does not get written by end of June 2023 
- June 2023 Amy Hsu informs us that Provost Dorothy Escribano has some ideas/interest. Amy writes: 

> Dorothy is extremely invested in bringing a Teaching and Learning Center to campus with a director (she suggested that the director should be faculty who is still teaching, perhaps half time?) and a faculty advisory group.  She would like to see regular events coming out of the center with organization of any campus event that has to do with teaching and learning, including a mentoring program and formal orientation for new faculty.  She realizes this transition will take a year or so to happen, but would like to support us in figuring out what is needed to make it happen. 
>I think this support is exactly what is needed to make the leap to the more permanent structure we were envisioning as we wrote the draft of the letter, then resolution, which was then directed by Jo-Ann Robinson to be written in the form of a proposal (though I would hold off on this step for now as I don't know that it will be necessary). 

Yogesh is meeting with Alexis Clifton, the director of TLC at SUNY Geneseo on Thursday, August 17 on Zoom (all are welcome) to discuss TLC at SUNY Geneseo, as they seem to be quite active TLC: https://www.geneseo.edu/tlc

I reached out to Alexis, mentioned the TLRC/CETL discussions and she kindly agreed to meet, and wrote
> One resource that I'll recommend is the POD Network https://podnetwork.org/outreach/ . This professional organization offers a huge wealth of resources and interpersonal support for people in our role, both dedicated full-time staff and those who do this work along with faculty responsibilities. Some material is available to nonmembers, such as the Growing a Faculty Resource Center kit at https://podnetwork.org/outreach/ .



### 2. TLRC Book Club, paper reading discussion group
This might be too much additional work on faculty. But perhaps a book one of us already wants to read. 
    
### 3. TLRC campus newsletter collecting links to interesting teaching articles, podcasts
Maybe send out a monthly or bi-weekly email of a curated list of articles, podcasts TLRC (or members of campus community) find interesting.

### 4. TLRC Brightspace repository
- I reached out to the instructional design team, and Michael Thompson has informed me that he can give access to the entire faculty when instructed to do so
- Perhaps discussion boards to discuss topics related to articles in aforementioned newsletter


### 5. SUNY Old Westbury TLRC webpage
- TLRC webpage at oldwestbury.edu is outdated
- CETL webpage is defunct (Access Denied)
- 2022-2023 TLRC group created a Brightspace course shell with some content but it is not open to faculty at large

### 6. Grants
- TLRC can seek grants (presumably for use in future years)
- Barb Hillery suggested UUP Labor Management Grant, as Eileen Landy had that years ago to start something similar

### 7. Speakers
- Invite speakers who have grants to promote social justice mission, e.g. 
- Barb has a list of speakers for AI
### 8. TLRC topics Faculty Survey
- Survey faculty at the beginning of the year for topics they are interested in hearing about, suggestions for speakers, books to discuss, feelings about a newsletter, maybe departmental book club
