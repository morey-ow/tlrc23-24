## Ideas, issues

### 1. Proposal to Combine TLRC-CETL

History:
- Idea (source unknown) originates to combine TLRC and CETL
- Amy Hsu (2022-2023 TLRC Chair) drafts a Senate resolution in January 2023 for combining CETL-TLRC  
- Jo-Ann Robinson suggests writing a proposal instead of a Senate resolution
- Proposal does not get written by end of Jun 2023 (reason given by Amy: waiting on template for a proposal from Jo-Ann)
- June 2023 Amy Hsu informs us that Provost Dorothy Escribano has some ideas/interest. Amy writes: 

> Dorothy is extremely invested in bringing a Teaching and Learning Center to campus with a director (she suggested that the director should be faculty who is still teaching, perhaps half time?) and a faculty advisory group.  She would like to see regular events coming out of the center with organization of any campus event that has to do with teaching and learning, including a mentoring program and formal orientation for new faculty.  She realizes this transition will take a year or so to happen, but would like to support us in figuring out what is needed to make it happen. 
>I think this support is exactly what is needed to make the leap to the more permanent structure we were envisioning as we wrote the draft of the letter, then resolution, which was then directed by Jo-Ann Robinson to be written in the form of a proposal (though I would hold off on this step for now as I don't know that it will be necessary). 

### 2. TLRC Book Club, paper reading discussion group
    This might be too much additional work; ideally a book someone already wants to read, and 

### 3.

### 4. Monthly or bi-weekly newsletter collecting links to interesting teaching articles, podcasts

### 5. SUNY Old Westbury TLRC webpage
    - TLRC webpage at oldwestbury.edu is outdated
    - CETL webpage is defunct (Access Denied)
    - 2022-2023 TLRC group created a Brightspace course shell with some content but it is not open to faculty at large

### 6. Grants
    - TLRC can seek grants (presumably for use in future years)
    - Barb suggested UUP Labor Management Grant
### 7. Speakers
    - Invite speakers who have grants to promote social justice mission, e.g. 
    - Barb has a list of speakers for AI
### 8. TLRC Faculty Survey
    Survey faculty for topics they are interested in hearing about, suggestions for speakers, books to discuss,
