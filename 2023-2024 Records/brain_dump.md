## Ideas, issues

### 1. Proposal to Combine TLRC-CETL

See the following page for the Request for Director and Resolution for Director documents by Amy Hsu

https://github.com/morey-ow/tlrc23-24/tree/master/2023-2024%20Records/resolution%20for%20TLRC%20director%20(2023)
History:
- Idea (source unknown) originates to combine TLRC and CETL
- Amy Hsu (2022-2023 TLRC Chair) drafts a Senate resolution in January 2023 for combining CETL-TLRC  
- Jo-Ann Robinson suggests writing a proposal instead of a Senate resolution
- Proposal does not get written by end of June 2023 
- June 2023 Amy Hsu informs us that Provost Dorothy Escribano has some ideas/interest. Amy writes: 

> Dorothy is extremely invested in bringing a Teaching and Learning Center to campus with a director (she suggested that the director should be faculty who is still teaching, perhaps half time?) and a faculty advisory group.  She would like to see regular events coming out of the center with organization of any campus event that has to do with teaching and learning, including a mentoring program and formal orientation for new faculty.  She realizes this transition will take a year or so to happen, but would like to support us in figuring out what is needed to make it happen. 
>I think this support is exactly what is needed to make the leap to the more permanent structure we were envisioning as we wrote the draft of the letter, then resolution, which was then directed by Jo-Ann Robinson to be written in the form of a proposal (though I would hold off on this step for now as I don't know that it will be necessary). 

Yogesh is meeting with Alexis Clifton, the director of TLC at SUNY Geneseo on Thursday, August 17 on Zoom (all are welcome) to discuss TLC at SUNY Geneseo, as they seem to be quite active TLC: https://www.geneseo.edu/tlc

I reached out to Alexis, mentioned the TLRC/CETL discussions and she kindly agreed to meet, and wrote
> One resource that I'll recommend is the POD Network https://podnetwork.org/outreach/ . This professional organization offers a huge wealth of resources and interpersonal support for people in our role, both dedicated full-time staff and those who do this work along with faculty responsibilities. Some material is available to nonmembers, such as the Growing a Faculty Resource Center kit at https://podnetwork.org/outreach/ .


What budget can administration provide? Dorothy's response:

> Please invite me to your next meeting.  I think the resource allocation for the Center for T&L should be discussed after the strategic plan for the Center is drafted.  We will look at your priorities for funding. 

I have some models from other SUNY comprehensive campuses that might be helpful.  I will share them before our meeting. 

Here is information Antonio Di Gregorio provided on TLRC Director Salaries:

Each individual school had "director" in its title. I could only locate some of the salaries from the Comprehensive colleges. 

Suny Fredonia and in 2021 had a reported pay of $87,065 (Associate Librarian / tenured)
Suny Geneseo and in 2021 had a reported pay of $84,288
Suny Oneonta and in 2021 had a reported pay of $73,594
Suny Oswego and in 2021 had a reported pay of $122,674 (Professor / tenured)
Suny Plattsburgh and in 2021 had a reported pay of $79,813 (Professor / tenured)



### 2. TLRC Book Club, paper reading discussion group
This might be too much additional work on faculty. But perhaps a book one of us already wants to read. Survey faculty
- Deep Work by Cal Newport
- Grading for Growth by David Clark and Robert Talbot
- Playful Pedagogy
- Master and his Emissary

    
### 3. TLRC campus newsletter collecting links to interesting teaching articles, podcasts
- Send out a monthly or bi-weekly email of a curated list of articles, podcasts TLRC (or members of campus community) find interesting.
- This might provide a low-cost/resource way of promoting a community of engagement around teaching and learning, while also allowing faculty a low barrier of entry to engage 

### 4. TLRC Brightspace repository
- I reached out to the instructional design team, and Michael Thompson has informed me that he can give access to the entire faculty when instructed to do so
- Perhaps discussion boards to discuss topics related to articles in previously newsletter



### 5. SUNY Old Westbury TLRC webpage
- TLRC webpage at oldwestbury.edu is outdated
- CETL webpage is defunct (Access Denied)
- 2022-2023 TLRC group created a Brightspace course shell with some content but it is not open to faculty at large

### 6. Grants
- TLRC can seek grants (presumably for use in future years)
- Barb Hillery suggested UUP Labor Management Grant, as Eileen Landy had that years ago to start something similar

### 7. Speakers
- Invite speakers who have grants to promote social justice mission, e.g. 
- Barb has a list of speakers for AI
### 8. TLRC topics Faculty Survey
- Survey faculty at the beginning of the year for topics they are interested in hearing about, suggestions for speakers, books to discuss, feelings about a newsletter, maybe departmental book club

**Budget**

The 2018-2019 budget (provided by Jillian Crocker, thanks Jill!) is here:
https://github.com/morey-ow/tlrc23-24/blob/master/Pre%202020-21%20Records/2018-2019%20TLRC%20Budget.pdf


> The last time I requested a budget it was for f18-s19, and we were allocated 4k (my notes attached; it was nothing especially formal). For me the process usually included my scheduling a meeting with Patrick, talking through our plan for the year, and showing him our proposal (the left side of the sheet for 2018).  Note on this .xls I did make a note that chartwells prices had increased, and since most of our expenditures were food at that time, it would impact future budgets.  (One might assume that honorariums for speakers have also increased a bit, if you’re doing that sort of thing.) The right side of the sheet is what we actually spent/did. 

 

Amy Hsu's very helpful guidance:

> You should ask Dorothy what your budget is.  Last academic year, I was given $1000.  Mary Reilly was able to give me the TLRC account # associated with the money once the provost confirmed a budget.  Then you can choose something from the Chartwells catering menu -https://sunyoldwestbury.catertrax.com 
I always looked at specials and tried to be reasonable.  It's hard to estimate number of people.  Be sure to keep an attendance sheet at the event, as this will need to be submitted, in addition to an event flyer when you pay the invoice.  The SOE department secretary gave me the following information which was very helpful in paying the bill:

>Place order with Chartwells
1.IMPORTANT: Keep a sign-in sheet for all who attend...They need this as a proof to pay!
2.After the event, Chartwells will send you an invoice for the order. (not the email that comes after order that is placed...this is a separate invoice that you will print)
3.Write on the invoice "ok to pay" and sign it. 
4.Send to Ellen Macconoran in Accounts payable with the budget number printed on the invoice.  They will put it through for you.

(Amy tells me that last year 2022-2023 TLRC was budgeted \$1000 from Provost, but used about \$100 for light refreshments. Outside speakers were paid \$250 (and all such sessions were remote) from CETL grant money. In-person sessions had local speakers but were not well attended.)

According to the TLRC Annual Planning Calendar (pre-2020):
- Select possible dates for fall events and reserve Red Room as early as possible.  
- We typically schedule events in Weeks 5, 8, and 11.  
- In the fall we sometimes schedule a “New & Newish Faculty Check-In and Grading Party” during Week 16 (finals week).  
- We typically reserve two dates for each event – a Tuesday/Thursday and a Monday/Wednesday (although typically not Mondays).  Once the committee meets in September to set the schedule and speakers are lined up, we cancel the backup dates by emailing Nick.  (This is important: if you don’t cancel, no one else can use those dates.)

### Open Educational Resources
- co-host events with OER committee (contact Joanne Spadaro)

### Playful Pedagogy
- Amy Hsu brought my attention to this topic; she has put in the Brightspace TLRC module two open books on the topic
- https://professorsatplay.org/ Here is a quote from the foreword by Peter Gray:
- >  My primary goal as a professor was to encourage critical thinking. Our testing and grading system has trained students not to think, but to memorize and regurgitate. Critical thinking is play; memorizing and regurgitating are not. Critical thinking is playing with ideas. We turn them upside down to see what happens, contrast them with other ideas to look for consistencies or contradictions, try them out on other people to get their reactions, and so on. Students come into the class believing they don’t have permission to think. They are mere students, so their job is to “learn,” not think, and learning means memorizing and regurgitating. To disrupt this ingrained schoolish habit and encourage thinking I developed what I call the idea approach to organizing a course." - Peter Gray, Professor of Psychology, Boston College in Forbes and Thomas. *Professors at Play Playbook*. Carnegie Mellon Press (2023)


### Teaching students how to learn how to learn
- potential speaker: Jennie D’Ambroise and waytosucceed.com
