# TLRC Meeting Sept 29 2023

## Agenda

## 1. Meeting with Provost about TCL

TLC Vision


The recent book **Centers for Teaching and Learning : The New Landscape in Higher Education (2023)** by Mary C. Wright is solely about TLCs and provides significant guidance. TLRC requested that our library purchase an ebook version, and it is available to the OW community through the following link

## 2. Update about Events

### Tuesday October 24 (not 26): Student Evaluations of Teaching

**Topic:** Taking as a given that SETs have well-documented intrinsic and structural problems that are difficult if not impossible to eliminate, how should we - individual faculty, departments, ARPT, and/or administrators(?) - talk about them, use them, etc.? What is helpful? What is not helpful?

  - speakers:
  Jillian Crocker (can't make October 26)
  Geta Techanie (confirmed)
  who else?

### Wednesday November 15: "Don't Fear the Beast: Unleashing Chat GPT in the Classroom"
**Speaker**: Prof. Jessica Williams (English) and a couple of her students

**Abstract**: This talk will share ideas about how educators might embrace AI in the classroom as a "study buddy" and versatile tool for aiding students in various processes and tasks, including revising written work, generating topic ideas, simulating peer review, and crafting personalized learning journeys. 

Jessica has requested help from TLRC to make a flyer.
Does anyone want to volunteer to make a flyer for the event?
