## Agenda

TLC Vision

The recent book **Centers for Teaching and Learning : The New Landscape in Higher Education (2023)** by Mary C. Wright is solely about TLCs and provides significant guidance. TLRC requested that our library purchase an ebook version, and it is available to the OW community through the following link

I felt that the vision statement was in general well-received and appreciated by Dorothy. However, she did inform us that having a full-time director is not feasible within the next two years. She suggested that a full-time TLC director may be a possibility in year 3. She instructed TLRC to identify an interim director who would be half-time TLC and half-time faculty, whose job it would be to formulate a three-year plan for a TLC so that by year 3, a full-time director can be a possibility. 

In TLRC discussions, some confusion arose with regards to the funding that CETL can and cannot offer. My understanding, based on our discussion a few weeks ago, was that funding CETL can provide was very limited at best. Specifically,

    the CETL grant is winding down, (ending in two years)
    you have allocated the majority of the remaining funds for events you have planned or are planning.
    while the CETL grant may be able to provide a small amount of funding for isolated TLRC events that fit the aims of the CETL grant (e.g.  high impact practices for student success), there are no funds for salary support for a half-time director of a TLC for the next academic year, or a semester, or just the summer

I reached out to Cris Notaro after the meeting to confirm and correct as necessary the above.


 


## 2. Update about Events

### Thursday October 19: Student Evaluations of Teaching

**Topic:** Taking as a given that SETs have well-documented intrinsic and structural problems that are difficult if not impossible to eliminate, how should we - individual faculty, departments, ARPT, and/or administrators(?) - talk about them, use them, etc.? What is helpful? What is not helpful? How can faculty challenge students and still get "good" evaluations? What are "good" evaluations, or alternatively, what is desirable (from the perspective of departments, ARPT) to see in evaluations?
