# TLRC meeting 

Date: 2023-08-28, 2pm

Location: Zoom 

# Agenda

### 1. Introductions


### 2. Chair's Report
---
- Provost wants to form Teaching and Learning Center, but wants it to be designed based on Faculty input. (And wants me to report to  faculty input back to her).
- SUNY Geneseo has a full time 12 month 1 person staff, but faculty "volunteer" to host events, mentoring, etc. Few outside speakers.
- TLRC faculty senate resolution. Last year's TLRC started it but then were told to abandon it in favor of a proposal.
---
- Funding for TLRC 2023-2024: Waiting to hear back from admin.
---
- TLRC Brightspace Repository (not yet visible to faculty). Please look at it and send me comments.
---
- Auburn AI course. Content is probably good/thoughtful, but licensing requirements (min of 100 users, \$30 per user) isn't right for our small campus. More expensive individual option may be available by Sept 1.

---
- Create a faculty survey about what they want from TLRC?:
a. what topics are they interested in?
b. TLRC restructuring
c. Book Club? What books?
d. Interest in an monthly or bi-weekly email 4-5 articles to read, maybe have a discussion board on Brightspace?
e. (your suggestion here)
