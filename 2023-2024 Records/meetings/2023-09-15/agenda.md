- Based on some points raised at the last meeting, I reached out to Prof. Jessica Williams asking if she would be interested in giving a talk on AI, and she replied she "would really love to give a talk on AI and definitely have some experiences using it in the classroom that I can draw from. I may try to find a student to join me and give their perspective on using AI in the classroom"
