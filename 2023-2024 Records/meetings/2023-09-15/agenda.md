# TLRC Meeting Sept 15 2023

## Agenda

## 1.  Events

- Based on some points raised at the last meeting, I reached out to Prof. Jessica Williams asking if she would be interested in giving a talk on AI, and she replied she "would really love to give a talk on AI and definitely have some experiences using it in the classroom that I can draw from. I may try to find a student to join me and give their perspective on using AI in the classroom"
- event on Student Evaluation of Teaching forms? - see email from Barb about New Faculty:

> I am following up on items related to the ongoing New Faculty Orientation.  Below is the schedule that was distributed at the initial orientation event on August 15.  Was the November event something that TLRC and ARPT wanted to hold?  This was not envisioned as the full fledge ‘getting to tenure’ workshop that was (pre-COVID at least) routinely held for all faculty in Feb by TLRC, ARPT, UUP.  Hopefully that is still occurring, and we can add it to a spring list of events.  The idea for this November event was a short introduction to the reappointment process, with a focus on the first reappointment.  It would be an opportunity to provide new faculty with information on the types of materials they should be collecting for their file, the types of activities ARPT looks add, an intro to the timeline, since they will need to start their file in Spring 2024 to be ready for a Fall 2024 first reappointment.  If it is appropriate, I would be happy to give a brief introduction to Interfolio.
> Let me know if you would like to discuss further.  I am hopibg to get a date on the schedule asap, so we can publicize and new faculty can plan.
>Thanks,
>Barb
