Getting to Tenure Workshop, joint with ARPT and UUP

Svetlana: AI and project-based learning  

Ed Bever: Regular and Sustantive Interactions in Distance Classes
- Federal Regulators have been focusing on this in the past few years, and we need to do what we can to make sure our faculty are aware of the issue and running their courses in compliance.  Also, it enhances the educational experience for students in online courses, and one of the remedial measures called for in last year's 5 Year Assessment of the Distance Program was "promoting steps to incorporate course management and teaching practices that heighten ... students’ connections with their instructors." (p. 30) 


Renu: Involve students who can share with faculty how they are using AI 

Shebuti: External academia expert for Responsible use of AI 

Cheryl Wilson/ Kyle Anderson: Respecting Religious Differences

- I’m reaching out to offer a topic for consideration for TLRC – culturally-responsive pedagogy, particularly in the area of respect for religious differences.  Some concerns have arisen recently from students, which has prompted me to reach out to see if this might be a welcome topic for our faculty. 

### 6. Review tasks to do and who is doing them
