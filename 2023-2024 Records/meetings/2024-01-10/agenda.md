We encourage those of you faced with the daunting task of assembling or updating a file to come with your questions and share experiences with others in the same situation, in addition to learning some of the successful techniques used by your colleagues. You are also welcome to bring your file along for us to take a look at.

- Federal Regulators have been focusing on this in the past few years, and we need to do what we can to make sure our faculty are aware of the issue and running their courses in compliance.  Also, it enhances the educational experience for students in online courses, and one of the remedial measures called for in last year's 5 Year Assessment of the Distance Program was "promoting steps to incorporate course management and teaching practices that heighten ... students’ connections with their instructors." (p. 30)
